#	DRC- Digital Room Correction for Volumio (previously Brutefir3)

This plugin is designed to use [brutefir](https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~torger/brutefir.html) with volumio2

It provides :

- A automated installation

- A automatic configuration - Just install and enable the plugin. It's ready for use !

- Hardware capabilities detection for output format and number of channels

- The use of custom filters - for DRC digital room correction created with RePhase

- Filters (left and right) can be selected in webUI.

- Specific attenuation for each pair of channels.



## NEW!

First experimental multi channel up to 2x4 !!! with hw detection capabilities of the DAC!



The plugin provide an exclusive feature we called __VoBAF__ : Volume Based Adaptativ Filtering ! Different filters may be applied depending on volume level. With that, it can apply filters such as adaptativ loudness.

- Place all VoBAF filters in the required VoBAFfilters shared directory. Up to 7 filters may be used. ( Low, LM1, LM2, LM3, M, HM, High )

- In webUI select first filter and enable VoBAF. Save, it's done!

- Now, when volume is changed, the plugin switches from a filter to an other smmothly!


The plugin is also able to auto generate filter in few clicks, just using a impluse from REW. To do that, it uses [DRC](http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net/). It gives very good results in few click!!!

 It will be documented soon!


To have a idea of what it is, have look here [brutefir plugin wiki](https://volumio.github.io/docs/Plugins_User_Manuals/brutefir/Drc_with_Volumio.html)




__Base scheme - signal path__

[volumio]--->[Loopback]--->[Brutefir]--->[output /DAC]


## INSTALLATION WARNING

First, you must have a working configuration with volumio, the dac you want to use and the mixer properly set.

## To install

Before intalling the dev version, __REMOVE__, if exists, the plugin from your system using the webUI plugins page and __REBOOT BEFORE INSTALLING__ a new version!

### 1. Enable SSH and connect to Volumio

To do that, have a look here : [ssh in volumio](https://volumio.github.io/docs/User_Manual/SSH.html)

### 2. Download and install the plugin

Type the following commands to download and install plugin:

```
wget https://github.com/balbuze/volumio-plugins/raw/master/plugins/audio_interface/brutefir3/brutefir.zip
mkdir ./brutefir
miniunzip brutefir.zip -d ./brutefir
cd ./brutefir
volumio plugin install
cd ..
rm -Rf brutefir*
```

### 3. Using the plugin

In webUI, enable the plugin and wait about 20seconds.

nearly everythings


## What is not working :

- ?
- mixer is not properly displayed in Volumio's playback option
